# Tonga_P-to-S_converted
The MATLAB GUI for picking P-to-S converted wave at the slab surface from the seismograms recorded by the Ocean Bottom Seismometers and land stations. 

The four sub datasets are from my current project on the Tonga-Lau subduction zone. The MATLAB GUI can plot the seismograms in both time and frequency domain for helping identify P-to-S converted wave.
